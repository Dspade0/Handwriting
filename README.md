# Handwriting

## Course project for Developing Applications for Mobile Devices

In this work we developed Android application for
Online Handwritten Character Recognition.

We implemented Greedy Point Match method as classification method
which is one of the main steps of recognition process.

The recognizer can be taught to understand a character that can
be suggested by specific menu where a user chooses listed variants.
Suggested template is sent to a server if host address is specified.

Simple server is implemented to gather and send existing templates.
